/**
 * <p>
 * The overlap mode is an enum that can be used to determine overlapping time ranges.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Usage</h4>
 * <p>
 * This class can either be used by directly using the overlap mode that you need in the given situation
 * or by requiring any {@code OverlapMode} as parameter. Works either way.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use it you can call {@link #isOverlapping(Date, Date, Date, Date)} with the first two parameters
 * being the start and end of the first period, and the last 2 parameters being the start and end
 * of the second period.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Alternatively you can pass in Java timestamps with the {@link #isOverlapping(long, long, long, long)} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The general contract is that the start and end of each period are allowed to be the same,
 * thereby describing a point in time rather than a time period.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations may or may not be able to handle flipped time periods
 * (that means that the start and end of a period is in reverse: end is before start).
 * Each implementation states whether it can handle flipped periods or not.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4> Example </h4>
 * <code>
 * class Period {<br />
 *   Date startsAt() {...}; <br />
 *   Date endsAt() {...} <br />
 * } <br />
 * <br />
 * Period p1 = ...; <br />
 * Period p2 = ...; <br />
 * OverlapMode.isOverlapping(p1.startsAt(), p1.endsAt(), p2.startsAt(), p2.endsAt());
 * </code>
